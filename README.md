## What did we build?
A Party Planner App


## What does it do?
Allows users to 'plan' for parties by having users create an account, where they can add guests, list items needed, designate a shopping list, etc.

## What was my role?
I was in charge of UI and building the landing page. I utilized
HTML, CSS, CSS Animations, Javascript and media queries to
create a responsive and interactive landing page.
